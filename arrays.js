//Some functions help with inserting elements and removing elements this is done by using call them by index number.
//For example the code below will call the function unshift on summerTemps and will add on 78 in the 0 index positions
summerTemps.unshift(78)
console.log (summerTemps)

//Another example would be calling the splice function on summerTemps. For the below line of code we would
// insert at the second index element in the array which in this case is 94 and insert 2 elements into 
//the array 90 and 70. 90 and 74 would then be in the third and fourth index position of the array. 
//94 and 100 would then me fifth and sixth index position consecutively. 


summerTemps.splice(2, 0, 90, 74)
console.log(summerTemps)
